# Daily-Planner-HTML-CSS-JQuery-MomentJS

The Horiseon Company has shared that they want to increase productivity and visibility across their teams within the organization.  They have hired me to create a daily planner so that their teams can have a shared calendar to schedule, view, and share goals, tasks, and events.

## Project Summary

The following tasks were completed based upon the User Story's acceptance criteria found below:


### User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
